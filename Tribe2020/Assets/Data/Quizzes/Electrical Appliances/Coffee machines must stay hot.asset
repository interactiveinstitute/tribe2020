  m_Name: Coffee machines must stay hot
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  question: There is no way to make good coffee if the coffee machine's head doesn't
    stay hot!
  options:
  - Then don't drink coffee!
  - It doesn't need to stay hot, it's enough to heat it a little before use.
  - Actually, most people prefer cold coffee.
  - Doesn't matter, as heating things barely uses energy at all.
