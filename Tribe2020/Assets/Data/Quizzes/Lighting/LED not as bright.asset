  question: LED lights are less bright than light bulbs though...
  options:
  - That's because you aren't looking hard enough.
  - No, but lights are ofthen labled with watts whereas lumens is how bright it is.
  - Then go outside during the day rather then rely on lights!
  - That can always be fixed by just having more lamps.
