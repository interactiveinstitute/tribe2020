  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  question: Lighting is such a small portion of the bill anyway, so it doesn't matter
    how you use it.
  options:
  - Yes, but every drop of saving matters!
  - That's because of the weather, which will get worse in the future.
  - In a home, lighting uses about as much energy as appliances do.
  - Don't think with your wallet, lighting always comes first!
