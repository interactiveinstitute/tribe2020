  m_Name: LED too expensive
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  question: LED lights are way too expensive compared to normal lights.
  options:
  - You are just looking in the wrong stores.
  - Expensive always means better. Always put quality first!
  - Then you are too poor.
  - Not in the long run. LEDs last much longer.
