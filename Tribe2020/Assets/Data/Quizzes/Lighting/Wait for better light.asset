  m_Name: Wait for better light
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  question: Lighting technology is changing too much. I'd rather wait before I invest
    in new lighting.
  options:
  - It's improved a lot, but that's no reason to wait.
  - No, lighting is as good as it's going to be.
  - Yes, but in a few years it might be wise to invest.
  - Then you are not as bright as you seem?!
